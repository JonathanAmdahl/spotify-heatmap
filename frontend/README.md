# Getting Started
1) Make sure you have NodeJS installed
2) Make sure you are CD'd in the frontend folder
3) run 'npm i' *you need to do this the first time and anytime someone installs a package (you will get an error reminding you if you forget)* 
4) run 'npm run dev'
If you forget any of this, you can look here again or look at 'package.json' as it contains the pre-made scripts to reuse.

# Hosting / Deployment
